# CLI-ATM-Mini-Project-
Making ATM through Command Line Interface using C++ 
In conclusion, the "ATM Machine through Console" project has been successfully implemented and tested, and it provides an efficient and reliable 
solution for providing banking services through the 14 console

The modular design and implementation in C++ make it easy to maintain, modify, and extend the system's features. 

The proposed system is an ideal solution for banks and financial institutions that aim to provide their customers with convenient and secure banking services. 

FUTURE WORK
To address the limitations of the traditional ATM machine system, the proposed ATM Machine through Console system must meet the following requirements: 

Accessibility: The system must be accessible to customers through a console, allowing them to perform banking transactions from the comfort of their homes or offices.
 
Security: The system must incorporate security features, such as PIN verification, to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the banking services. 

Convenience: The system must be user-friendly, allowing customers to navigate through the various options using simple commands.
Maintenance: The system must be easy to maintain and upgrade through software updates, which can be done remotely.
